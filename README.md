Negativity always seems to find its way to the top, giving way to [Gresham's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law), giving way to [Godwin's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law) (this one less often), and
all the others between and beyond. The comment shuffler exists to remove any
community biases that establish comment popularity. This way, a user can read a
random sample of comments without needing to scroll to an arbitrary point in the
comment tree.

Click the extension icon to shuffle the HN comment tree. Parent and child nodes
are shuffled together. Click it again or refresh the page to set the original
order. The extension gives no indication that the comments are out of original
order.
