An Egalitarian comment tree for those of us with a less polished hand. This browser extension will soon be available on [addons.mozilla.org](addons.mozilla.org). In the mean time, I'll incorporate the [Webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) for cross-browser capability. I also have plans to write tests and to transcribe this to typescript.

### Note:
This extension is not yet published on [addons.mozilla.org](addons.mozilla.org) because manifest v3 is not  accepted as of Q4 2022.
